# Problem statement 

The problem this program aims to solve is the need for a simple 
and accessible way to keep track of daily expenses without relying on complex software or external tools.
It provides a basic system where users can record each expense with its date, description, and amount, view all recorded expenses, 
delete incorrect or outdated entries, and calculate the total spending. The goal is to help users manage and monitor 
their personal expenses efficiently through a straightforward, menu-driven Python application.

# Scoop of the project

The scope of this project is limited to providing a basic, console-based expense management system that allows users to add,
view, remove, and total their expenses. It focuses on fundamental functionality without involving databases, user accounts,
or advanced data storage—expenses exist only during the program’s runtime. The project serves as a foundation for understanding 
object-oriented programming, input handling, and simple data management in Python, and can be expanded in the future with features like persistent storage,
categorization, reports, or a graphical interface.

# Target users 

The target users for this project are individuals who want a simple and lightweight way to track their daily expenses
without the need for advanced budgeting apps or complex financial tools. It is especially useful for beginners
learning to manage personal finances, students who need a basic expense log, or Python learners who want to understand
how data can be organized and manipulated through object-oriented programming. Additionally,
it can serve educators or developers looking for a straightforward example to teach or demonstrate basic program structure and user interaction in Python.

# High Level Features 

This project offers several high-level features, including the ability to record expenses with key details such as date
description, and amount, and maintain them in an organized list. It provides essential management functions like adding 
new entries, viewing all stored expenses in a clear format, removing selected expenses, and calculating the total amount spent.
The program also includes a simple, menu-driven interface that guides users through each action,
making it easy to navigate and operate even for beginners.
